# PyBank

## Background

Tasked with writing a Python program for analyzing the financial records of your company. The data will be provided in a file called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.

The program will analyze the the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset
  
  * The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period
  
  * Calculate the changes in Profit/losses over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
  
  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  
  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
  
  * The analysis should look similar to the this:
  
  
  ```text
  Financial Analysis
  ----------------------------
  Total Months: 86
  Total: $38382578
  Average  Change: $-2315.12
  Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
  Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
  ```

  * In addition, the program should output the results to the terminal and text file.

# PyPoll

## Background

It is time to help a small rural town modernize its vote counting process. The poll data will be provided in a data file called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate.

The program will analyze the the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast
  
  * A complete list od candidates who received votes
  
  * The percentage of votes each candidate won
  
  * The total number of votes each candidate won
  
  * The winner of the election based on the popular vote
  
  * The analysis should look similar to the this:

  ```text
  Election Results
  -------------------------
  Total Votes: 3521001
  -------------------------
  Khan: 63.000% (2218231)
  Correy: 20.000% (704200)
  Li: 14.000% (492940)
  O'Tooley: 3.000% (105630)
  -------------------------
  Winner: Khan
  -------------------------
  ```

* In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
